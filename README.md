## What is this for?
Once I researched this topic, but it did not produce meaningful results. Now it's just to demonstrate time series compression by different autoencoders.

## Datasets
1. StarLightCurves (UCR Archive 2018)
2. Gas sensor array temperature modulation Data Set
3. Commercial Building Energy Dataset (COMBED)
4. Individual household electric power consumption Data Set
